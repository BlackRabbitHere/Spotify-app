# Spotify Web App (HTML & CSS Version)

This project is a simplified version of Spotify's web interface, built entirely using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to practice and get hands-on experience with HTML and CSS concepts, such as layout, responsiveness, and styling.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a mock-up of Spotify’s homepage layout.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes buttons for Home, Search, and Your Library, similar to Spotify’s navigation.
- **Music Player Interface**: A basic music player UI at the bottom of the screen, mimicking the style of the Spotify player.
- **Album/Playlist Section**: A grid layout to display playlists and album covers.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for mobile and desktop screen sizes.
